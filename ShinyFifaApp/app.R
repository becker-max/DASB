Funnily enough the accuracy also doesn't have a strong positive correlation to either height or weight, which is clear if we look at the BMI relationship. Since the BMI is medium to strongly correlated to height and weight but relatively low to the heading accuracy gives us the clear impression that height and weight, so therefore the BMI, has to be in a certain range to be optimal for a players performance.
